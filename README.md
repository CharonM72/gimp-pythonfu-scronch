# gimp3-pythonfu-scronch
A fairly simple GIMP 3.0 Python-fu script that will export the full, flattened, current image as a .png with smart filenaming.


Intended to be set to a keyboard shortcut for quick and easy exporting.


ONLY WORKS IN GIMP 3.0 - For a Gimp 2.x-compatible version, see https://github.com/CharonM72/gimp2-pythonfu-scronch

Windows:

C:\Users\[yourname]\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\3.0\plug-ins\scronch

Unix-like:

~/.config/GIMP/3.0/plug-ins/scronch/


The script will be registered directly at the bottom of Filters.
